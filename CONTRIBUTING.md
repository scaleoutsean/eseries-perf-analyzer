# Contributing

For v3.1.0 and above, please submit your request against `develop` if it exists (I delete it when I don't need it), otherwise `master`.

You may also submit bugs in Issues.

For v3.0.0 it's better to submit against upstream, or try latest release of this fork and submit your pull request here.
