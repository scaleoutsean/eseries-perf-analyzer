# EPA Screenshots

As you can see in `./epa/grafana-init/dashboards/`, there are four dashboards. The last one shown here I created at some point but didn't keep it, so you'd have to add a panel or dashboard to visualize those measurements.

- **System**

- **Disks** (bottom) - basic SSD life remaining visualization shows disks from two systems, one of which is older and its disks aren't at 100%
