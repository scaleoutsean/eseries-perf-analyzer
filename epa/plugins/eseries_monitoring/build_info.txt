# This file defines the order in which components for this plugin are built.
# Components are built from top to bottom.
# Per-line: first is the folder containing the Dockerfile, and second is the output image tag
# NOTE: The output image tag will be prefixed with "ntap-grafana-plugin/*plugin_directory_name*/"
#      	The output image tag is optional, if omitted it will match the Dockerfile directory

# ex. The alpine image here will be built from the folder "plugins/eseries_monitoring/alpine_base"
#     and will be tagged "ntap-grafana-plugin/eseries_monitoring/alpine-base"
#
#     The webservices image here will be built from the folder "plugins/eseries_monitoring/webservices"
#     and will be tagged "ntap-grafana-plugin/eseries_monitoring/webservices"
